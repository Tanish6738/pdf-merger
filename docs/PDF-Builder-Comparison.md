   // New
   import SimplePDFBuilder from './Components/SimplePDFBuilder';
   ```

2. **Update navigation routes**:
   ```javascript
   // Add new route
   case 'simple-builder':
     return <SimplePDFBuilder onNavigate={setCurrentView} />;
   ```

3. **Remove complex dependencies** (optional):

## Conclusion

The Simplified PDF Builder represents a focused approach to the most common use case: converting images to PDF. By removing complex features that were rarely used, we've created a tool that:

- **Loads faster** and uses less memory
- **Works better** on mobile devices  
- **Requires no learning curve** for new users
- **Delivers results quickly** with minimal steps
- **Maintains high quality** PDF output

This simplification aligns with the principle that **80% of users need only 20% of the features**, and those core features should work exceptionally well.
